# FLINTpro Data Check
Created by Harrison McKenzie-McHarg

This plugin is designed for FLINTpro users to easily check the compatibility of data for uploading to FLINTpro.

FLINTpro is a Software as a Service (SaaS) for the modelling and monitoring of land sector greenhouse gases. The system allows users to manage the natural capital assets within large land portfolios.

## Features

:white_check_mark: Checks the data storage of the selected datalayer

:white_check_mark: Checks that the attributes are in a compatible format

:white_check_mark: Checks that the geometry of the data layer is compatible with FLINTpro

:white_check_mark: Ensures the CRS of the datalayer is correct

:white_check_mark: Checks for overlaps in vector datalayers

:white_check_mark: Checks for errors in the selected datalayer

## Notes
The current version of the plugin does not support the checking and validation of raster data layers. Currently only vector data types are supported.
